# 000 Foundations

## Intent
Keep shared UI/UX guidance principle-first so downstream products can retain local identity while applying consistent quality standards.

## UX Effect
Improve design consistency, decision speed, and cross-repo clarity without forcing uniform visual output.

## Accessibility Implication
Accessibility needs must be explicit at principle level so downstream implementations include intent-level a11y risk and mitigation before shipping.

## Failure Modes / Anti-patterns
- Treating shared guidance as rigid UI templates.
- Applying principles without local context from `docs/site-soul-brief.md`.
- Skipping explicit accessibility risk + mitigation in task/PR outputs.
